  <h1>How to use the TaxDome Help Center</h1>
  <p>
    TaxDome&rsquo;s Help Center is your go-to resource for getting started,
    solving issues, and learning how to use the platform effectively.
  </p>
  <h2>Before you start</h2>
  <p>
    The TaxDome Help Center is open to everyone &mdash; no login needed. It
    lets you explore the platform at your own pace. Whether you&rsquo;re just
    getting started or looking to fine-tune your workflow, you&rsquo;ll find
    step-by-step guides, visuals, and practical tips for every part of
    TaxDome.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your clients also have their own
    <a href="https://client-help.taxdome.com/">Client Help Center</a>
    &mdash; a simple guide to help them use the client portal with ease.
  </p>
  <h2>Accessing the Help Center</h2>
